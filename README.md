## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

### 🔐 What is a Secret Recovery Phrase?
It’s a 12-word phrase that gives you full access to your wallet. **Do not share it.** If lost, your wallet cannot be recovered.

### 🧪 Why is the ETH not showing?
Ensure you’re on the **Holesky Test Network** and the faucet has processed your request. It might take a few minutes.

### 🔄 Can I reset my account?
Yes, go to MetaMask → Settings → Advanced → Reset Account. This only clears local activity and not your actual funds.
